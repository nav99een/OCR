My father was born in 1922 in the aftermath of the First World War and
the Spanish Flu. He grew up hearing war stories from his uncles who
had served overseas, and never knowing those in his family and
community who died of influenza.

He was baptised into life in the dirty thirties and the Great
Depression where he wore socks on his hands to keep them warm in
winter because he had no mitts.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, he was a young,
strapping lad of 17, eager to defend his country, to escape the labour-
intense work in the woods and to get a regular meal.

In the summer of 1943, he arrived in Italy and served with the West
Nova Scotia Regiment until he was found killed in action on the
battlefield at The Gothic Line.

But the stretcher bearers later found him alive when they gathered
the dead.

He spent four months in hospital recovering from the loss of a lung
before he returned to his regiment where he spent the duration of the
war. He returned home to the province he loved in February 1946,
battle worn, emotionally scarred and determined to find a better life for
himself.
