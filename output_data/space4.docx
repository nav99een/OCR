Felix Driver, “Henry Morton Stanley and His Critics”
The history of exploration has until recently been dominated by two
sorts of historical writing: biographies, which of necessity focus on the
life and personality of individual explorers, and somewhat Whiggish
general histories, which have tended to celebrate the triumph of
modern geographical science over the mysteries of the earth. Neither
of these approaches is particularly well equipped to meet the
requirements of a more contextual perspective, concerned with the
wider contemporary significance of the ideas and practices of
exploration. In recent years, historians have paid much more attention
to the institutional, intellectual, and social contexts in which projects of
exploration were sustained, emphasizing in particular the relationship
between exploration and empire. Whether explorers like Stanley are
considered to be “progenitors” or merely “precursors’ of the new forms
of imperialism developing during the late nineteenth century, their
labors at the colonial frontier must be seen ii the wider context of
changing relationships between Europe and the non-European world. It
has been suggested that the attitudes and assumptions of explorers
constitute a kind of “unofficial symbolic imperialism,” helping to define
the cultural terms on which unequal political relations between
colonizer and colonized could subsequently be established. The fact
that British explorers of Africa... received official sanction and support
is, according to this view, but one aspect of their contribution to
imperial history; another is their role in the popularization of myths and
fantasies about the non-European world. For geographical exploration
did not merely overcome distance; it helped created “imaginative
geographies.” Joseph Conrad once described the most famous African
explorers as “conquerors of truth,” not because they exposed the inner
secretes of distant regions (as they often claimed), but rather because
they established particular ways of reading unknown landscapes.
