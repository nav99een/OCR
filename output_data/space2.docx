Magellan’s circumnavigation [of the globe] forever altered the Western world’s ideas about
cosmology — the study of the universe and our place in it — as well as geography. It
demonstrated, among other things, that the earth was round, that the Americas were not part
of India but were actually a separate continent, and that oceans covered most of the earth’s
surface. The voyage conclusively demonstrated that the earth is, after all, one world. But it also
demonstrated that it was a world of unceasing conflict, both natural and human. The cost of
these discoveries in terms of loss of life and suffering was greater than anyone could have
anticipated at the start of the expedition. [The voyagers] had survived an expedition to the ends
of the earth, but more than that, they had endured a voyage into the darkest recesses of the
human soul. (Lawrence Bergreen, Over the Edge of the World)
During the Civil War era many factions sought to change America. Remarkable speakers spread
their ideas through oratory, thrilling their audiences through powerful speeches that appealed
to both emotion and logic. Frederick Douglass, a black American, fought for black civil rights
through compelling speeches like “What to the slave is the Fourth of July?” which depicted the
terrors of slavery in graphic detail. Abraham Lincoln, on the other hand, spoke peacefully and
optimistically during his Second Inaugural Address to demonstrate his desire for peace and
reconciliation with the Confederate states. Both speakers captivated their audiences through
persuasive diction, tone, and argumentative methods in an effort to win them over and gain
their support.
Conflicts within the middling orders were more pronounced than peaceful cooperation. Tariffs
on imports were a boon to domestic manufacturers but a burden on merchants. Distribution of
largesse from the central government, whether paintings donated to provincial museums or
subsidies provided to struggling industries let to disputes about favoritism among cities and
regions. The issue of state support for sectarian schools became a contentious issue between
devout and secular citizens. The location of the railroad network, which speedily spread
through most of Europe in the 1840s and 1850s, became a matter of virtual economic life and
death across the map. And, ... limitations on the right to vote on the basis of income were sore
points between bourgeois safely at home in the political elite and bourgeois aspiring to join
them Some of these contests were trivial: in the late nineteenth century, Munich and Berlin
engaged in a rivalry, carried on mainly in the press, over which was the cultural capital of
Germany. But most of the time, the stakes were higher than this. Economic self-interest,
religious agendas, intellectual convictions, social competition, [and] the proper place of women
became political issues where bourgeois battled bourgeois. (Peter Gay, Schnitzler’s Century)
