Slave spirituals often had hidden double meanings.

On one level, spirituals referenced heaven, Jesus, and the soul; but on
another level, the songs spoke about slave resistance.

For example, according to Frederick Douglass, the song “O Canaan,
Sweet Canaan” spoke of slaves’ longing for heaven, but it also
expressed their desire to escape to the North.

Careful listeners heard this second meaning in the following lyrics: “1
don’t expect to stay / Much longer here. / Run to Jesus, shun the
danger. / | don’t expect to stay.”

When slaves sang this song, they could have been speaking of their
departure from this life and their arrival in heaven; however, they also
could have been describing their plans to leave the South and run, not
to Jesus, but to the North.

Slaves even used songs like “Steal Away to Jesus (at midnight)” to
announce to other slaves the time and place of secret, forbidden
meetings.

What whites heard as merely spiritual songs, slaves discerned as
detailed messages. The hidden meanings in spirituals allowed slaves to
sing what they could not say.
